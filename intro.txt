Use yamp to send SMTP mail from M$ hosts like at least so:

c:> yamp -ssmtphost -rsomeone@some.place
where smtphost is an smtp server like mailsrv or mailsrv.shoprite.co.za or 
mail.mweb.co.za or 172.20.1.136 or chkbuy or chkbuy.shoprite.co.za or chkord 
or swan.mail.pas.earthlink.net, you get the general idea.

This will make yamp send an email to someone@some.place with subject "No subject" and body "No message body".

To include a subject do
c:> yamp -ssmtphost -rsomeone@some.place -u"This is the subject"

To include a message body do 1 of the following:
c:> yamp -ssmtphost -rsomeone@some.place -u... -b"This is the message body"
or
c:> yamp -ssmtphost -rsomeone@some.place -u... -bfilename.txt
or
c:> yamp -ssmtphost -rsomeone@some.place -u... < filename.txt
where filename.txt contains the message
or 
c:> echo "This is the message body" | yamp -ssmtphost -rsomeone@some.place

For more verbose output add a -v somewhere.

To send to multiple recipients do:
c:> yamp -ssmtphost -ruser1@shoprite.co.za,user2@shoprite.co.za,user3...
or
c:> yamp -ssmtphost -ruser1@shoprite.co.za -ruser2@shoprite.co.za -ruser3...
or combinations of the above.

To specify a reply-to address (cause you can't reply to SYSTEM@remedy)
c:> yamp -ssmtphost -rsomeone@some.place -treply.to.me@a.nother.place

You can add attachments:
c:> yamp -ssmtphost -rsomeone@some.place -a"awordoc.doc"
or
c:> yamp -ssmtphost -rsomeone@some.place -a"awordoc.doc","anotherwordoc.doc"
or
c:> yamp -ssmtphost -rsomeone@some.place -a"awordoc.doc" -a"c:\winnt\system32\ntoskrnl.exe"
or combinations of the above.
Yamp can mail itself:
c:> yamp -ssmtphost -rsomeone@some.place -ayamp.exe -u"Here's me"

You have to have at least an SMTP server (-s flag) and one recipient (-r flag), the rest is optional, unlimited and order is not important.
